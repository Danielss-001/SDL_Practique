#  SDL PRACTICE || JUMP AND RUN


###  Here I practicewith SDL Framework. I don't use any special architecture, I just learn how to implement this framework, to use it in other projects later on. 
###  From creating a simple window, to implementing events and collisions, all practicing with a simple jumping game
## Beginner´s error 😐😑

### Ok, this project started with the idea of learning the SDL Library for different projects in the future. However, I didn´t imagine it to be extensive and complex (I LOVE IT!). For that, I use this space to document all the progress, and differents ideas or solutions in the various obstacles in this development. In order, to better understand SDL3 and implement in future projects 🤗.

## 1. First, create the window and the rendering configuration
### Here, I use a class to implement this configuration. Maybe, I Think is better to create a class for the window and a class for the rendering, given that, the rendering will be used for the camera configuration 🤔...
